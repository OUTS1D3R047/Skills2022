## Task 1 - GitHub
**Preparation:** Nothing is required, everything is installed  
**Implementation:** To do this task, I created repository on GitHub, then I created it on my local VM. After that I connected to my repository and now I can add files to it.  
**Troubleshooting:** I had some problems with authentication when I was connecting my local repo to the Web. This was fixed by using a personal access token instead of password.  
**Verification:** You see my repo :)    

## Task 2 - Ansible Skills Test
**Preparation:** Nothing is required, everything is installed  
**Implementation:** To do this task, I created two files - hosts and .yml playbook. The hosts files contains ip adress of the server and .yml file contains instructions, necessary to have task performed. After that I started the playbook and enjoyed the results.  
**Troubleshooting:** I faced no issues during this task.  
**Verification:** All results are captured as a screen shots, which are placed in Task2/ScreenShots folder. I captured the process of checking the server's availability and the playbook performance itself.  

## Task 3 - Docker
**Preparation:** I installed NTP  
**Implementation:** To do this task, I downloaded a docker image using docker pull cturra/ntp. Then I ran a container. After that I used ntpdate -q <DOCKER_HOST_IP> and enjoyed the results  
**Troubleshooting:** I faced a "no suitable servers found for synchronization" error. Reboot helped to fix this problem.  
**Verification:** All results are captured as a screen shots, which are placed in Task3/ScreenShots folder. I captured the output when starting the container, then I captured its performance in processes, and finally I captured the ntpdate output
