## Task 1 - GitHub
**Preparation:** Nothing is required, everything is installed  
**Implementation:** To do this task, I created repository on GitHub, then I created it on my local VM. After that I connected to my repository and now I can add files to it.  
**Troubleshooting:** I had some problems with authentication when I was connecting my local repo to the Web. This was fixed by using a personal access token instead of password.  
**Verification:** You see my repo :)
