Task 1 - GitHub
Preparation: Nothing is required, everything is installed
Implementation: To do this task, I created repository on GitHub, then I created it on my local VM. After that I connected to my repository and now I can add files to it.
Troubleshooting: I had some problems with authentication when I was connecting my local repo to the Web. This was fixed by using a personal access token instead of password.
Verification: You see my repo :)
